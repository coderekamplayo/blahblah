## Introduction

This repository is a sandbox for future projects—whether that’s exploring web development, game design, environmental education, or any other exciting area in tech. Each project will have its own folder and documentation. I believe in clean code, clear documentation, and thoughtful development practices, and this repo is an extension of that philosophy.

## Features

- **Modular Structure:** Each project has its own directory for easy navigation.
- **In-Depth Documentation:** Explaining the thought process and structure of each project.
- **Scalable Setup:** Designed to accommodate a continuous flow of new experiments and prototypes.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
